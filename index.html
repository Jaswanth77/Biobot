                <h3>Concrete Tank</h3>
                <p>Concrete storage tanks have been used for water and chemical storage for decades. It should be noted though, as technological advancements in the chemical storage industry are made concrete tanks have become less common over the years. This is because concrete does not have the same material properties as stainless steel, plastic or fiberglass. Different types of concrete storage tanks include underground, poured on site and pre-made. Sometimes concrete tanks are requested to be lined with poly in order to mitigate potential leak issues.</p>

                <h3>FRP Tank</h3>
                <p>It has resistance to rust, corrosion, heat and abrasion. It is also lighter compared to steel or concrete tanks. Fiberglass tanks advantages also include customisation, reliability and easy installation and modification processes. Types of FRP chemical storage tanks include single-wall or bunded, underground, above ground, horizontal or vertical. The capacity for underground storage can reach 500,000 litres while the above ground capacity is 75,000 litres.
                The advantages of concrete are its strength, durability and applications in residential and commercial settings. Disadvantages include being susceptible to cracks or leaks, due to steel reinforcement and Lime which is found in concrete, as well as being more difficult to transport due to its weight.
